# @cozero/client

The frontend application.

## Running the app

By default, the webpack dev server is listening to the [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) port. This can be configured in the [vite.config.js](./vite.config.js) file, changing the `DEV_SERVER_PORT` constant.

### In development

```sh
# Runs the webpack dev server (using HMR)
yarn start:dev
```
